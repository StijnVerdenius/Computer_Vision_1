function acc = test_model(model, imgs, labels) % EX. 2.6 --- is this the prefictor part?
% trains a SVM model with bows representations. (NOT FINISHED)

% is this the prefictor part? If yes this is the function used below    
% ScoreSVMModel = fitPosterior(SVMModel,X,Y); %this fits a score-to-posterior-probability transformation function to the scores
%[label,score] = predict(SVMModel,newX);

% TODO: entire function
acc =0;
